# AESVerilog - A Verilog HDL Implementation of AES cipher

This project is currently under development and is not yet ready for deployment

## Testing for Sequential Part

Inputs:
	- 128-bit input block
	- 128-bit key
	- Clock
	- Reset (must force it to 0 and back to 1 before giving input)
	
Outputs:
	- 128-bit output block 
	- Finish (turns HIGH after output is produced)

## Testing for Combinational Part
Inputs:
	-128-bit input block
	-128-bit key
	-Clock
Outputs:
	-128-bit output block
